# NBA Game Predictor

This is an NBA machine learning program built using Python and the scikit-learn library designed to predict the outcome of NBA games based on various features and historical data from 12,000+ previous games. It utilizes a Random Forest classifier and implements feature selection techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

## Framework
Python, Scikit-learn, Beautiful Soup, Numpy, Pandas 

## Features
* Multiple ML feature predictions for enhanced accuracy (Random Forest, XG Boost, Linear Regression)
* Web scraped 12,000+ NBA games + box scores for most up-to-date statistics
* Incoporates contextual information about games such as home court advantage, back-to-back games, etc using selective data preprocessing with Pandas
* Result verified with test-train split, cross validation, and visualization tools like confusion matrices

## Build
To use the NBA Machine Learning Program:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/vishalramvelu/NBA-Game-Predictor-ML.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the program: `python main.py`
4. Follow the prompts to interact with the program and view the prediction results.
